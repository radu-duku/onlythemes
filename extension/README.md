# 💖 Ready for a Theme Connection?

There are over 5,000 themes on the
[Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode),
yet most developers use one of the top 20 most popular. Are you stuck using
the same, old theme as everyone else? Surely, there's a theme that would
suit you better. But how do you find it?

## Only Themes

The Only Themes VS Code extension allows you to explore themes without
having to install them. As you view the theme, you can give each
theme a "thumbs up" or "thumbs down." As you review themes, our machine
learning-powered recommendation engine will begin to learn more about
your preferences and start showing themes that it believes you would
enjoy.

## ❓ How to use it

After installing Only Themes, click on the icon in your VS Code activity
bar. A theme will load allowing you to:

### 🔎 See more detail

Clicking the image of the theme will expand it larger to see color details
more easily.

### 🔗 View the extension on the marketplace

Clicking the link icon will open the extension on the VS Code Marketplace.

### 🙁 It's not a match

Don't think this is the theme for you? Click the "thumbs down" icon to
move on to the next theme.

### 💘 I think I'm in love

Maybe this is the theme you've been dreaming of! Click the "thumbs up" icon
to let us know you like it. We'll even offer to install the theme and activate
it for you.

### 🔥 I want to start over

If you'd like to just start completely over so that all of your previous ratings
are thrown out, try using the Command Palette (Cmd + Shift + P), and choose "Forget My Ratings".
This will confirm you want to do it, and will start you from scratch.

### 💻 How does it work?
